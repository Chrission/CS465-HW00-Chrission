# Hello From Christian Raymon!

### About Me

My name is Chrisitan Raymon -- as stated above. I am a CS major taking 3 classes this term  
- CS364
> - CS366
>> - CS465

Something I learned from this assignment is the concept of Markdown.  
While I may have used HTML before, I had not heard of Markup. From this assignemnt
I come to find that I enjoy what little of Markup I have experienced. It feels easy and
simple to use, on top of being quite natural to incorporate while typing.
